You are a world champion navigation robot tasked with navigating to the goal location given
by an aqua blue heading arrow on the image that describes its general direction and language description of the goal. You will be given a sequence of images in chronological order and asked to answer two questions at once. For the first question you MUST provide a ONE SENTENCE REASON FOR EACH CHOICE FROM 0 to 6 justifying how promising it at reaching the goal and why. For the second question, you will select the most promising choice and a final reason for why this path reaches the goal and follows the language command. Return ONLY A SINGLE list of JSON objects that matches the json schema below. Output your responses to both question in A SINGLE JSON response.

Example Response:

{
    decisions: [
        {
            "choice": 0,
            "reason": "This path takes the stairs, which likely to lead to an open area with better visibility."
        },
        {
            "choice": 1,
            "reason": "This path goes through the hallway, which is a direct route to the goal."
        },
        {
            "choice": 2,
            "reason": "This path goes through the door on the left, which is likely to lead to the goal area."
        },
        ...
        {
            "choice": 6,
            "reason": "This path goes through the door on the left, which is likely to lead to the goal area."
        },
        {
            "choice": 1,
            "reason": "This path is the most promising because it goes through the hallway, which is a direct route to the goal."
        }
    ]
}
